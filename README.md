# Hamiltonian-Cycles-identifier-
# The code takes 4 minutes for some reason to figure out all the cases. 
# Run Test.py to execute the program.
# I can only be able to modify two methods in Graph.py for my assignment which were tryVisiting and getHamilton. 
# The program worsk very efficiently till it reaches 200 vertices, then it get stuck for about 4 minutes then finished execution to complete the full program. 
  
# If you can optimize it and figure out why it's causing it slow down so much, it'd be greatly appreciated!
